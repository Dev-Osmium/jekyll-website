# Background
As seen in [this blog post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-02-26-FinchRIOLib %}), I am working on a library for the [Finch](https://finchrobot.com) that makes the provided Finch API resemble that of WPILib. I am planning to use this as a training tool for FRC teams using Java, as it is a relatively simple robot with little to no complication in connecting and running code.

# Javadocs
Rather than just document all the methods, I'm going to do the sensible thing and make a javadoc for this. No point in doing anything else, as it'd take far too long, and wouldn't be nearly as complete as I'd like it to be.

# GitHub
As specified in the blog post, here's the GitHub link.
